I am an assistant teaching professor in the [Data to Knowledge Lab](https://d2k.rice.edu/about) (abbr. D2K Lab), [Statistics Department](https://statistics.rice.edu/about), at Rice Unviersity. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Electrical & Computing Engineering (ECE) depeartment at the University of Delaware in 2022, under the supervison of Charles Black Evans Professor [Kenneth Barner](https://www.ece.udel.edu/people/faculty/barner/).

My research focuses on machin learning theory, eXplaianble AI (XAI), spatial-temporal forecasting, and computer vision. My research philosophy is to empower AI by statistics. Specifically, I aim to promote AI by applying statistical theory to explain the behavior of AI models and then optmizing the performance of AI models in different applications. 

Recently, I have been very interested in the following research topics:
- Explaining the attention mechanism based on Bayesian theory and kernel methods for time series forecasting.
- Optimizing Transformers for spatial-temporal forecasting to improve extreme weather resiliency. 
- Improving image style transfer based on distribution matching and Fourier theory.
- Improving domain genearlization based on information theory.
